# quick start

produce some dummy histograms
```
./generateTestHist.py
```

run a test
```
./processHist.py testHist.root mycfg.py hist.root
```
- 1st argument: root file with raw histograms
- 2nd argument: cfg file that defines how raw histograms are transformed into efficiency, scale and resolution plots
- 3rd argument: root file with final histograms


# code

generateTestHists.py
   - generates some histograms to test the code

histprocessing.py
   - defines classes used to configure transformation from raw to final plots
   - defines how raw plots are transformed into final plots (getHits functions)

mycfg.py
   - an example cfg file to ilustrate how the code functions or is supposed to function

processHist.py
   - the executable, see 'quick start' above for instructions


# notes

This little framework is prety simple right now.
Unfortunately that is likely to change when we add more and more features.
